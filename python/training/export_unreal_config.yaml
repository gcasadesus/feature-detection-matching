# Pair generation
step: 1  # Step between consecutive frames (used if use_overlapping_pairs=false and max_sep=null)
max_pairs: null  # Maximum number of pairs to export
cameras: ["front_left"]  # Cameras to export

# Overlapping pairs options
use_overlapping_pairs: false  # Use overlapping pairs instead of step-based pairs
extractor_config: null  # Path to extractor config JSON (required if use_overlapping_pairs=true)
camera: "front"  # Camera name for overlap detection
max_depth: 100  # Maximum depth for features
thresh_dist: 0.025  # Distance threshold for covisibility (meters)
min_covisible: 200  # Minimum number of covisible features
